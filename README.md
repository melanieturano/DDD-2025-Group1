## Project title

### Data Collection
**Where did you get your data from?**

Data come from different sources. In particular data related to Hebrew terms, their literary translation, their etymological origin, and the    count of how many times they are repeated in the Old Testament were entered into the Bible Hub website and the Hebrew encyclopedia. For all the information related to the "classical" theological interpretation of the words we used Bible Hub while for Mauro Biglino's interpretation, we relied mainly on his book "The Bible does not speak of God". Consultations on Wikipedia were also helpful, particularly pages related to the topic of Ancient Astronaut Theory and the Uphological Religion [https://biblehub.com/, https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/, https://pdfcoffee.com/mauro-biglino-2015-la-bibbia-non-parla-di-dio-5-pdf-free.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_religion]
- what’s your data about? [describe]
- who is/are the sources/creators of your data?

#### Data Organisation
- have you combined data from different sources? How did you merge them?
- what columns are more relevant for your project?
- have you used any AI-based tool to understand or manipulate your data? if yes, what and how
