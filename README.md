## Alien saves the Queen
General research question: What would be the consequences in society if it were discovered that God is actually an alien?

Specific research question: Are there elements within the Hebrew version of the Old Testament that suggest that God is not actually a spiritual being but an extraterrestrial being?

## Data Collection
**Where did you get your data from?**

Data come from different sources. In particular data related to Hebrew terms, their literary translation, their etymological origin, and the    count of how many times they are repeated in the Old Testament were entered into the Bible Hub website and the Hebrew encyclopedia. For all the information related to the "classical" theological interpretation of the words we used Bible Hub while for Mauro Biglino's interpretation, we relied mainly on his book "The Bible does not speak of God". Consultations on Wikipedia were also helpful, particularly pages related to the topic of Ancient Astronaut Theory and the Uphological Religion. Mauro Biglino also has a YouTube channel where he posts numerous videos about his interpretations of the Bible. He has been a guest on several podcasts and television shows, in particular we listened to what he talks about in two episodes of the Muschio Selvaggio podcast

**What’s your data about?**

The data collected encompass not only their translation but also their interpretation from two different points of view. The dataset consists primarily of these data: relevant terms extrapolated from Biglin's analyses, translation from Hebrew, theological interpretation, Biglian interpretation, etymological analysis (less relevant to us), theme of belonging, biblical passage of reference, and the number of times the word is repeated in the Old Testament (with the Old Testament in this case we refer to the books of the Hebrew version of the Bible). This dataset does not claim to answer our research question but rather allowed us to highlight the most relevant interpretative inconsistencies (at least according to what Mauro Biglino claims).

**Who is/are the sources/creators of your data?**

- Bible Hub website
- Digital version of Jewish Encyclopedia
- Wikipedia
- Biblino, M., "La Bibbia non parla di Dio", 2015, Mondadori
- Muschio Selvaggio Podcast
- Mauro Bigligno Offical Youtube channel

## Data Organisation
**Have you combined data from different sources? How did you merge them?**

We combined several data points from different sources since we were unable to find an already complete dataset (as we actually expected). It was therefore necessary to analyze various sources in order to build a dataset that was useful to us but, above all, allowed us to gain an overview of the two opposing interpretations. Our aim was therefore to bring out these differences without, however, claiming to provide a concrete answer to our research question, much less to give one interpretation as absolute rather than the other. For this reason, data related to the translation and etymology of the words were inserted into the dataset. The most complex part was actually the one related to interpretations because, obviously, there are no theological resources that report all possible interpretations for each word, especially if these are tendentious. 

**What columns are more relevant for your project?**

Link to the dataset: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bEMc1wfIMF3otExb9zqieQAxsSfdBCDZOdFhocw6ygo/edit?gid=531522946#gid=531522946]
The most relevant columns are obviously those related to the two interpretations of Hebrew terms. The purpose of the visualization is to provide the user with an insight into the general of the two interpretations. The user will then get an idea on the topic. The other columns are less relevant for visualization purposes because they are simply intended to contextualize the chosen words (which is why the bibliographic passage is reported rather than the translation of the words or the theme)


**Have you used any AI-based tool to understand or manipulate your data? if yes, what and how**

AI tools were used (in particular Chatgpt and Gemini). As mentioned, it wasn't easy to put together a dataset containing the two different interpretations; artificial intelligence helped us with just that. We specifically asked Chatgpt to help us understand which words are most discussed by Biglino so we could get an idea of the number of words to work with. AI was provided with a full PDF version of Biglin's book, the Bible Hub website, and the Hebrew encyclopedia, and asked to compare interpretations, focusing specifically on what Biglin says and what contemporary theology says. The system was able to comply with the request quite easily and, subsequently, we verified what was indicated. During the review, we also integrated data related to translations, etymology, biblical passages, and word repetition. Rather, we used Gemini to hypothetically make us say what would happen in society if Biglino's theories were confirmed. However, we did not abibate the provision of specific reliable sources and the analysis remained hypothetical. 


## Data visualisation
**Data visualisation description**

The visualization shows data emerging from research on some Old Testament Hebrew terms and their interpretation. In particular, two interpretations were compared: the traditional theological one and that of Mauro Biglino. The visualization also shows how many times each word in the Old Testament (bubbles) is repeated, the bibliographic reference, and the macrotheme assigned to the word (which can change based on the two interpretations). These last data were inserted to give context in addition to the various interpretations.


## Website

The built website aims to report all the contents of the project, as well as the visualization. On this site you can not only consult the results but also the dataset and understand the process carried out.

**Aesthetics**

The site allowed us to place the entire project within a very specific aesthetic context that aims to recall the theme of extraterrestrials.

**Impact matrix**

We are keen to highlight an important aspect of the final matrix. This support is the result of personal thoughts made within the group following the research carried out. The matrix refers to thoughts and findings that remain hypothetical and are not necessarily related to the dataset. The construction of this matrix allowed us, even in a fun way, to provide answers to the question "What would happen in society if it discovered that God is an alien?" Read it then in a critical spirit but without taking it too seriously
