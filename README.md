### Data Collection
**Where did you get your data from?**

Data come from different sources. In particular data related to Hebrew terms, their literary translation, their etymological origin, and the    count of how many times they are repeated in the Old Testament were entered into the Bible Hub website and the Hebrew encyclopedia. For all the information related to the "classical" theological interpretation of the words we used Bible Hub while for Mauro Biglino's interpretation, we relied mainly on his book "The Bible does not speak of God". Consultations on Wikipedia were also helpful, particularly pages related to the topic of Ancient Astronaut Theory and the Uphological Religion

**what’s your data about?**
The data collected encompass not only their translation but also their interpretation from two different points of view. The dataset consists primarily of these data: relevant terms extrapolated from Biglin's analyses, translation from Hebrew, theological interpretation, Biglian interpretation, etymological analysis (less relevant to us), theme of belonging, biblical passage of reference, and the number of times the word is repeated in the Old Testament (with the Old Testament in this case we refer to the books of the Hebrew version of the Bible). This dataset does not claim to answer our research question but rather allowed us to highlight the most relevant interpretative inconsistencies (at least according to what Mauro Biglino claims).

#### Data Organisation
- have you combined data from different sources? How did you merge them?
- what columns are more relevant for your project?
- have you used any AI-based tool to understand or manipulate your data? if yes, what and how
